This is my repository where I work on different, school related, projects. They will mainly include homework and occasionally a small project that uses designs and/or structures currently discussed in my lessons.
This repository includes a more advanced form of my MazeSolver repository. It is located in /AAI/MazeAlgorithms
Resource Gatherer is a project I am working on for Game Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence where I create a simple game filled with different algorithms and artificial intelligence
